                <h3>Earth System Modelisation</h3>
                <p>During my master in geology, we used programming (Fortran,Matlab) to predict the climatic condition of our earth depending on the path that we would take. For example, there was 3 differents possibilities: first, if we did nothing about greenhouse gas, the second, if we stopped every emissions right now and the third was an average between both. We had to take into account the different type of gas (CO2, H2O (yep), CH4,...), their concentration and the average temperature at time=0 and the average emission of each gas. We had to write the algorythm and add it to an already existing program that after running would show us the result of each prediction. </p> 
                <p>Sorry to say this but ...we are doomed (to live with the errors of the past and work hard to make it better).</p>
